Implementation of a [Dash7](https://dash7-alliance.org/) ALP protocol codec from its public specification.

The goal of this library is to implement a specification with an emphasis on correctness, then
on usability. Performance and memory usage are currently considered a secondary objective.

Status
==================================================================================
The current specification is fully implemented.
The API is not ergonomic, but should be usable.

This library was not used in any project yet, so there are probably a few bugs lying around.
Plus there are probably some obvious ergonomy problems.
